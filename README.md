I have created a project in Power BI using source files from Excel. In this project, i have calculated various metrics such as sales, profit, quantity, and order ID. I have also utilized tools like Power BI, Excel, and VLOOKUP.

Power BI is a business intelligence tool that allows you to visualize and analyze data from various sources. It provides interactive dashboards, reports, and data modeling capabilities.

Excel, on the other hand, is a spreadsheet program that offers a wide range of functions and formulas to perform calculations, manage data, and create charts.

VLOOKUP is a function in Excel that allows you to search for a specific value in a column and retrieve corresponding information from another column. It is often used for data analysis and data retrieval purposes.

By combining the capabilities of Power BI and Excel, you can import data from Excel into Power BI, perform calculations, create visualizations, and generate insightful reports or dashboards based on the imported data.
